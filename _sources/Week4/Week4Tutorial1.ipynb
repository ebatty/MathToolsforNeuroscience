There is some rate at which the channels open, dependent on the voltage of the cell, $\\alpha(V)$ and some rate at which they close, $\\beta(V)$. These would be in units 1/ms (essentially the number of times in a ms that a gate which is open closes and vice versa) and can be found empirically. We suddenly step the voltage to one that opens channels and keep it at that voltage. Although $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are normally voltage-dependent, we will treat them as constants from here on out since we are holding the voltage steady.\n",

We will take you through this process step by step.\n",
